			ROTATE Directory
			****************

This directory exists to automate rotation of JPG files.

Copy all the files you want to rotate to this folder, then click
on 090.BAT, 180.BAT or 270.BAT to rotate the corresponding number of
degrees clockwise.

The resulting files are placed, with the same name, in the ROTATED
sub-folder.
