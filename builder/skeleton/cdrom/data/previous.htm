<font size=+2><b>A Partial Transcription</b></font> was made of some tombstones in the church yard and also inside the church, up to the end of the 19th century. This transcription was recorded by Chas J. Girling and M. Goodey in 1934, and was typed and indexed for Oxfordshire Family History Society in July 1997. Although these tombstones and plaques were numbered as plots, there does not appear to be a surviving plan which accurately locates them. It has been
possible to correlate most of these with the existing transcript and some inaccuracies have been
found. Where the earlier transcript includes text which is no longer readable, this has been used to supplement the present transcript.

<p>
<font size=+2><b>The Interior of the Church was Refurbished</b></font> in the 1990's. This exposed a number of floor stones which are now covered by the new wooden floor. Photographs were taken and a transcript made before work was started. Both the photographs and the transcript have
been used here, by kind permission of Janet Wedgwood, for those monuments which are now hidden.
