<font size=+2><b>The Village of Cholsey</b></font> is an old settlement
formerly in the county of Berkshire but now in Oxfordshire. It has a long
history showing some evidence of Roman and Saxon occupation. During this time
it has been mainly an agricultural area set in low lying arable land, bounded
on the east by the river Thames. A number of smaller streams ran through
the village and helped to power the mills that were mentioned in documents from
1086, 1570 and 1694.
<p>
Several roads meet in or cross through the parish - the main one being the road between
Reading and Wallingford. Other means of transport were provided by the Great Western
Railway which opened in 1840 and crosses the parish and the river.

<font size=+2><b>The Church of St Mary</b></font> is situated on rising ground at the
edge of the village. It was built around the middle of the twelfth century on a site
previously occupied by an abbey and probably in a cruciform shape, with a tower.
Over the years it has had numerous alterations and additions (in the 13th, 15th,
19th and 20th centuries) but some of its Saxon origins still show. It has a peal of
eight bells, the oldest of which is thought to date from the late 13th century.

churchyard as it appeared in 1794. (Click the picture for an enlarged view.)

<font size=+2><b>The Churchyard</b></font> used to have a very old Yew Tree, which came down in hurricane force winds on 25th January 1990. The Yew wood was saved by Janet Wedgwood and her husband Alan, who built a special large lathe to turn 
the huge pieces of wood. Many beautiful items, large and small were made, 
including bowls, dishes, candlesticks, and even tables. They were all sold in aid 
of the Church Restoration Fund, raising much needed money whilst providing treasured mementoes of the lost tree. Small wooden crosses were made from some of the wood and these were given to some parishioners.
