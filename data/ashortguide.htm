style='font-size:15.5pt;line-height:99%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
letter-spacing:1.1pt'>You are now at the base of the tower which formerly stood
between the chancel and the nave of the Saxon church built about 1040. The
tower, which is now at the west end of the building, originally had the nave to
the west of it and communicated with it through a wide archway. This archway,
filled up with masonry and a Decorated window, now forms part of the wall. The
opening to the chancel, where the nave is now, has been replaced by a moulded
drop arch supported by Early English attached piers. The ground floor of the
tower formed part of the nave which, as its gable ends reveal, had high walls and
a steeply-pitched roof. </span></p>

style='font-size:15.5pt;line-height:99%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
letter-spacing:1.1pt'>The windows were unglazed and, as may be seen from the
arch of exposed stones in the south wall, were high. They were very narrow
externally and deeply splayed internally. The tower had no stairs and the upper
chambers were reached by ladders, for the church had a use in defence. The
north and south walls have been breached to admit pointed arches with alarming
results, as the leaning north east pier shows.</span></p>

style='font-size:15.5pt;line-height:99%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
letter-spacing:1.1pt'>About 1165 the Normans built a new nave to the east of
the tower which, formerly axial, now became western. The Norman piers and
Transitional arcades show that this nave was aisled from the beginning which
was unusual in a small church at this early date. Moreover, the aisles engaged
the tower north and south, which was also unusual; and there was no chancel.
The low-pitched nave roof is of tie-beam construction; all principal members
are moulded, and the whole is supported by braced wall-posts resting on wooden
corbels carved as grotesque heads. The bowl of the font is Norman but was
re-chiselled in 1842 after serving for many years as a water-butt. </span></p>

discovered by G. E. Street under several coats of whitewash, and cleaned, when
he restored the church in 1864. It was treated again in1967 under the direction
of Mrs. Eve Baker who has written this description of it. </span></p>

between Early English and Decorated, is longer than the nave and has high walls
and a steeply-pitched roof. (Note the waggon-type interior timbers.) The Early
English attached piers, now terminating at their capitals, probably supported
an arch. There were five Decorated windows but the two most westerly have been
lost in later alterations. Other features of interest to the visitor are the
Priest's Door in the south wall and, within the sanctuary, a recessed bracket
piscina with credence shelf both surrounded by a trefoil pointed arch. The
monument higher on the wall is to Robert Perrott who died in 1605. </span></p>

moulded and cusped arch springing from the floor, containing our only brass; it
is to Thomas Beckingham who died in 1431. Note the organ which has great
historical significance. It was built by Henry (“Father”) Willis in about 1860.
Previous to coming to North Leigh it was in All Saints, Hawkhurst. After
conservation and restoration the organ was installed here in 1997. The opening
in the wall behind the choir stalls, enclosed in a beautiful ogee arch richly
decorated with crockets and finial, reveals the Wilcote Chapel which you should
now visit. </span></p>

order of Lady Elizabeth Blackett for masses to be said daily for the souls of
her first husband Sir William Wilcote, their two sons (one of whom was killed
at Agincourt), and for herself. It is attributed to Richard Winchcombe who was
in charge of the building of the Divinity School at Oxford in its early stages.
It is a fine example of Perpendicular Gothic and Fan Vaulting and one of the
most notable to be found in a small parish church. Note the delightful bracket
piscina supported by a small pillar in the south wall, and its trefoil arch
worked from a solid block and decorated with florets in the arcs formed by the
cusps. The windows contain fragments of old glass. </span></p>

letter-spacing:1.1pt'>  The beautiful alabaster effigies on the table tomb,
thought to represent Sir William Wilcote and wife, are well-known and
outstanding specimens of this art. The monument above the piscina is to William
Lenthall whose famous son (bearing the same name) was Speaker of the House of
Commons in 1640. The chapel was re-dedicated in 2000 following the installation
of the polyptych painted by Nicholas Mynheer, also the altar and chairs
designed and made by Waywood.</span></p>

Christopher Kempster of Burford, a master mason who worked on Tom
 Tower at Christ Church and on the dome of St. Paul's, of whom Wren had a high
opinion. James Perrott's own memorial is in the centre of the north wall. Its

nave roof will be recognized at once, and round the pointed fourteenth century

immediately under the gable ends suggest the presence of a door, or a window
which looked out from a chamber into the nave. All four walls have belfry
openings with semi-circular heads cut from the solid and surrounded by a
relieving arch in masonry, with dressed stone jambs, square capitals, and a
mid-wall supporting shaft turned in stone. In the second stage the north and
south walls have narrow round-arched windows. There is no 'long and short work'
here; the quoins should be described as 'side alternate'. The embattled parapet
