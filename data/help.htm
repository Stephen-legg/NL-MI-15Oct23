<b>We have tried to make using this CD version of the transcription
as intuitive as possible. These few notes
should help you to get the best out of it.</b>
<p>

<font size=+2><b>System Requirements</b></font> are a PC with a CD ROM drive and any
reasonably up to date web browser. The layout has been optimised for a screen resolution
of 800 x 600, but you should get perfectly acceptable results at other resolutions.
<p>
No files are copied to your computer when you use this CD and there is nothing to
uninstall afterwards.
<p>
<font size=+2><b>A Navigation Bar</b></font> at the top of most pages lets you move
between the transcriptions of individual graves, the <b>Index</b> and the <b>Plan</b>
of the graveyard.
When viewing a page, the <b>Next &gt;</b> and <b>&lt; Prev.</b> links let you step
to the adjacent graves in the numbering sequence.
<p>
<font size=+2><b>The Plan of the Graveyard</b></font> is initially shown at low
magnification to give an overview of the whole graveyard, with the separate areas
shown in different colours. If you click in any area, you will get a magnified view of
that area, showing individual graves. Scroll bars in your browser window, allow
you to view the whole area. Provided your browser supports JavaScript, the magnified view
will automatically open centred around the place where you intitially clicked the overview plan.
<p>
By clicking on an individual grave
number, you will be taken straight to that grave. (Note that on some small graves, the
number is placed beside the outline of the grave rather than inside it. In every case,
it is the number you should click on, not the outline of the grave).
<p>
If you want to find other graves in the same area, you will find it best to use your
browser's <b>Back</b> button, to return to the plan. This will take you back to your
previous location on the magnified plan. Alternatively if you use the <b>Plan</b> link
on the navigation bar, you will be taken back to the overview plan.
<P>
<font size=+2><b>The Index of Names</b></font> provides the easiest way to get to a
specific person's grave. Simply clicking on the grave number in the right hand column will
take you straight there.
<p>
If you want to find other members of the same family, you will find it best to use your
browser's <b>Back</b> button, to return to the index. This will take you back to your
previous location in the index. Alternatively if you use the <b>Index</b> link
on the navigation bar, you will be taken back to the start of the index.
<p>
The index is intended as a finding aid. To that end, if the inscription reveals the maiden
name of a married woman, she will be indexed twice, once under her maiden surname and once
under her married
surname.
<p>
Where possible we include an age in the index. If this is given on the stone we will
use that age. If birth and death dates are given on the stone, an accurate age will be computed
from these. If only birth and death years are given, an age will be obtained by subtraction
(but may be a year too great, if the person died earlier in the year than their birthday).
If no age is indicated on the stone but an age is given in the burial register, this will be
used. (Bear in mind such BR register ages are often only an estimate by the parish clerk.)
<p>
<font size=+2><b>You can Magnify</b></font> most of the pictures, by clicking on the image.
This will produce a page containing just the picture, at its full magnification.
In some cases supplementary images are available showing further details of interest
or alternative views of the grave. Clicking on the magnified image will take you through
all the available images in sequence, before finally returning you to the normal inscription
page. You may use your browser's <b>Back</b> button to step backwards through this sequence.
Alternatively you can at any time, return straight to the normal inscription page by clicking
the <b>Back to Inscription</b> link in the navigation bar.
<p>
<font size=+2><b>To Exit</b></font> the program, just close the browser window and remove the
CD from the drive.
