<i>Roll top chest tomb. The top is decorated with a spiral design to represent a bale of wool. This is a common design in Cotswold churchyards where there was a woollen industry, but this is the sole specimen of this type of tomb in North Leigh. There are three panels on the north and three panels on the south side of the tomb. The central panels on the north and south, and the left panel on the north side have inscriptions, but these are almost entirely illegible. This tomb has been listed by English Heritage as a Grade 2 monument, Ref: SP3813 21/168 - "Bale tomb approx. 13m SW of S porch of Church of St. Mary. Late C17. Limestone. Corner balusters and Moulded inscription panels. Scalloped bale with skulls set in shell alcoves." - South side, central panel inscription:</i><p>
<center><b>In memory of Eliza <br> beth daughter of <br> [John] [&] Ann [EELES] <br> [----] [Aged] [-]4 [Years] <br> [three further lines not decipherable] <p></b></center><p>
<i>North side, central panel</i><p>
<center><b>In memory of <br> Ann wife of [Jn] <br> [EELES] who died <br> 11 [------] 1[-][99] <br> aged [74] years <p></b></center><p>
<i>North side, left panel</i><p>
<center><b>In memory of <br> [J][oh-] [E][---] <br> [who] [----] <br> [----] [----] <br> Aged [80] <p></b></center><p>
<i>[BR - North, left - "1793 15 Jun EELES John" -- AND --North, central - "1799 27 Feb EELES Ann widow of John". The inscriptions contradict the Grade II listing assessment of its being late 17<sup>th</sup> century. In fact it's late 18<sup>th</sup> century. ]
