<font size=+2><b>This Record</b></font> of the Monumental Inscriptions at the Parish Church
of St Mary, North Leigh,
Oxfordshire, was made by a team of local parishioners, on behalf of Oxfordshire Family History Society between 2017 and 2019. It was
prepared for distribution in text form as a paper copy and on microfiche.
<br>
This electronic version, distributed as a compact disk, comprises the full text of the
transcript, with the addition of photographs of the graves taken during the transcription.
<p>
<font size=+2><b>The Plan</b></font> which accompanies this record, was prepared from
a survey carried out by members of the transcribing team, during the transcription. It includes all the visible
monuments in the church and graveyard.
<p>
<font size=+2><b>The Numbering System</b></font> used to identify the graves, splits the
church and graveyard into ten sections, designated by the initial letters
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>R</b> and <b>W</b>. This letter is followed by a number of three digits indicating the individual grave within the section.
<br>
The Sections are:
<dl compact>
<dt><b>A</b><dd>The north-western area of the graveyard, coloured pink on the plan.
<dt><b>B</b><dd>The south-western area of the graveyard, coloured green on the plan.
<dt><b>C</b><dd>The church itself, coloured grey on the plan.
<dt><b>D</b><dd>The late Victorian area of the graveyard, coloured violet on the plan.
<dt><b>E</b><dd>The early Victorian area the graveyard, coloured turquoise on the plan.
<dt><b>F</b><dd>The area of the graveyard to the south of the church, coloured blue on the plan.
<dt><b>G</b><dd>The area of the graveyard to the south-east of the church, coloured lilac on the plan.
<dt><b>H</b><dd>The area of the graveyard to the north-east of the church, coloured pale rose on the plan.
<dt><b>R</b><dd>The cremation area of the graveyard, coloured light brown on the plan.
<dt><b>W</b><dd>The area containing the War Memorials, coloured grey on the plan.
</dl>

In areas of the graveyard where graves are in clearly visible rows, the numbering system
reflects this.
In areas where the positioning of the visible graves is less regular, a simple sequential numbering system has been adopted. There are a number of places where one or more
additional graves were discovered during the recording, for which there was no
available number. In such cases the number of an adjacent grave is used, with a suffix letter
added.
<p>
<font size=+2><b>The Convention Used</b></font> when recording the inscriptions, is the standard
method, whereby only the surname is shown in capital letters, with the rest of the inscription
in lower case. There is no attempt to follow the capitalisation, or typeface, of the original
inscription. Capitalisation of initial letters of names and the start of sentences follows
modern practice. All punctuation visible on the stone is transcribed as accurately as possible,
within the limitations of the computer typeface. In certain cases a compromise has to be made.
Most noticeably, many stones have the word "ye" written as a small "e", directly above the "y".
This is represented here with the "e" as a superscript, immediately following the "y", thus:
<b>y<sup>e</sup></b>.
<P>
Where part of a stone is not decipherable square brackets are used to indicate missing letters
or words, thus <b>[  ]</b>. If the spacing of the surrounding letters gives a clue to the number of missing letters
these will be marked within the bracket thus: <b>[_ _ _]</b>. If a letter is in doubt, it will be
placed in square brackets in the same way, or possible alternatives may be indicated, thus:
<b>Died 187[0 or 6]</b>.
<P>
In traditional paper and fiche transcripts the "/" symbol is used to indicate line ends,
in order to save space. In this CD version, space is not at a premium and
the lines are placed as found on the stone. However no attempt is made to
fit the modern type to the correct line lengths and all the lines are centred. The true layout
can usually be judged from the photograph.
<P>
<font size=+2><b>Additional Information</b></font> about the grave, is shown in italics. Normally
this consists of a brief description of the grave, preceding the inscription. In some cases
further information may be added, in italics, following the inscription.
This is often information from the Burial Register, indicated thus: <b><i>BR.etc.</i></b>.
This is only included where it adds information, or confirms or contradicts something read
from the stone.
<p>
