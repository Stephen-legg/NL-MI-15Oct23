<i>[ The Roll of Honour was displayed for many years in North Leigh Methodist Church, where Leonard Gough, one of those killed, had a senior role, and where there is a memorial stone in his name. It was rediscovered in 2017, while clearing the storage area. It was subsequently relocated to the foyer of North Leigh Memorial Hall, alongside the village memorial board that had been erected in the 1920's at the time that the original memorial hall was built. The village board contains all nine of the Methodist Roll of Honour names, and a further ten names of other North Leigh men who gave their lives in the Great War. ]
