<i>Headstone, shallow oval top. Ornate high relief decoration across the top and in wide borders down either side and with further decoration across the bottom of the stone, leaving an oval slightly domed plain area in the centre containing the inscription. At the top centre there is an urn or lamp, with folded material draped over it and through loops on each side. The material drapes across to either side and over the angled head of a cherub set on a pair of wings. Decorative swirls of vine leafs are woven down the broad side borders. A garland of flowers is draped over a scallop shell in the centre of the lower edge of the stone. The inscription faces west.</i><p>
