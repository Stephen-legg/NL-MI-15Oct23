<i>Chest tomb, grade II listed, ref: SP 3813 21/166. A 17<sup>th</sup> Century limestone tomb chest, it was restored in 2010, at which time the plinth and south face was replaced. It has no traces of an inscription on any of the three remaining original faces. In an old photograph, it can be seen that it was originally surrounded by a railed fence. There is nearby a plaque on the south wall of the church that contains the inscription:</i><p>
<center><b>Within this Rail Lyeth the Body of Ed.wd <br> PERROTT Esq See Ye Monument in Ye Church <br> for a More Particular Account also Margaret <br> his wife. <p></b></center><p>
<i>The monument C4 inside of the church contains the inscription:</i><p>
<center><b>In memory <br> of Edward PERROTT Esq <br> Eldest son of Robert PERROTT Esq <br> and Susanna his wife <br> with whom he lies buried in ye Churchyard <br> This monument was erected <br> by Margaret his relict <br> who having liv'd happily with him 46 years <br> desird at her death <br> not to be divided from him <br> Robert aged 75 died April.18. 1698 <br> Susanna aged 86 died Nov. 27. 1716 <br> Edward aged 76 died Jan.24. 1729 <br> Margaret aged 66 died Feb.24.1731 <p></b></center><p>
<i>[Based on the above inscriptions, it might be inferred that the chest tomb possibly contains the remains of Robert and Susanna Perrott, and their son Edward and his wife Margaret. ]
