<i>Headstone, square top, with shaped shoulders. The face of the stone has weathered badly and no inscription remains. There is a footstone, also with square top and shaped shoulders. It has a badly weathered face, but the portion below the surface has the following inscription:</i><p>

<i>[BR: "1779 21 Nov VINER Mary - Hailey - wife of Robert". From the Baptism records, we can see that their daughter Ann was baptised on the same day that Mary was buried. Robert was buried in North Leigh in 1806. In his will he is described as a Labourer, and leaves his cottage and land at New Yatt (in Hailey parish) to his sons John and William.]
