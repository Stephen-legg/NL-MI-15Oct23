<i>Mantel top chest tomb with 6 inscribed side panels. There are two inscribed panels on each of the south and north sides and one panel on each of the east and west sides. The panels have on either side full height narrow arched designs. At the top corners of the panel is a design of three pears. At the bottom corners there is a design resembling a four petal poppy. There are traces of black paint on parts of the design, and some of the lettering retains black paint. The top of the tomb has a shallow coping, and on each corner of the top there is a triangular stone "lug", having a design of a three lobed fruit on the two outer sides. In a photograph from the mid 1900s, this tomb is surrounded by railings, which were presumably removed in the 1940s. There are two inscriptions on the south side. The left hand one is:</i><p>
