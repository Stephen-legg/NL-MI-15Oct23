<font size=+2><b>Oxfordshire Family History Society</b></font> was founded in 1976
to encourage and promote the study of Family History. It caters both for those with
Oxfordshire ancestry (who usually live at a distance) and for those who live locally
(whose ancestors usually come from elsewhere). The Society is a Registered Charity, No. 275891, and a member of the Federation of Family History Societies.
The aims of the Society are:
<BR clear=all>
<UL>
<LI>to foster interest in Family History and aid the progress of beginners
<LI>to provide, through publications and meetings, a means for exchanging news and information
<LI>to widen knowledge of the variety of genealogically useful records
<LI>to help preserve the most commonly used records by transcription, indexing and publication
<LI>to record fast-disappearing monumental inscriptions
</UL>
This CD has been produced, in furtherance of the last of these aims.
