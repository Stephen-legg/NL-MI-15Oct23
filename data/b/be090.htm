<i>[The latin inscription translates to "my hope is in God", and is sometimes used as a Masonic motto. A brief biography of Dr Wells runs as follows: "My old friend Clement Wells was buried at North Leigh, one of the loveliest churches in the Cotswolds. He had been both general practitioner and parson in the area, having taken orders after retiring from medical work, and the church was crowded with his former patients and parishioners, people talking with the delightful Oxfordshire burr, so much more agreeable than the ugly accent of Oxford city. Clement had lived a full life, hunting as well as practising, and taking part, I think, in both wars. At any rate, it was into his arms that Himmler collapsed dying at British General Headquarters, after swallowing the capsule of poison which he had secreted. "It's a wonderful thing," said Clement to me, at about the time that he retired, "I've never had to worry about my body"; a wonderful thing indeed to me, who seem to have spent my life worrying about mine.". BR: "1975  19-Aug  WELLS  Clement John Lethbridge  84  ., New Yatt  15-Aug-75  90" - ALSO - "1978  17-Feb  WELLS  Vera  82  . New Yatt  13-Feb-78  90"]
