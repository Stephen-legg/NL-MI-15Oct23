<i>Headstone - Oval top with ogee shoulders on a double plinth with flower recesses at left and right. The headstone is inscribed with a cross at the top centre. Square vase in centre of plot, inscribed "In loving <br> Memory of <br> Izzy" on its east face. The quotation at the conclusion of the inscription on the headstone is from the poem 'Adonais', by Percy Bysshe Shelley.</i><p>
<center><b>In loving memory of <br> A dear daughter <br> And sister <br> Isabella Amelia <br> SPILLANE <br> 30th May 1993 - 4th Jan 1996 <br> Awakened from the dreams of life. <p></b></center><p>
<i>[This is the northernmost plot in Section B row (x) and is numbered on the in-church plan as 184, which must be a mistake, since the plot to its left is also numbered 184. Hence it is referenced in this record as plot 184A. However, note that the BR numbers the CADD plot as 183, so there is confusion between the in-church plan and the BR.  BR: "1996  09-Jan  SPILLANE  Isabella Amelia  2  ."  - Note:- plot number not given in the BR. ]
