<i>Headstone - square top with rounded shoulders and indentations either side. Decorated with daffodils and barley. Separate plain vase.</i><p>
<center><b>In <br> Loving memory <br> Of <br> Evelyn Nellie <br> WOODWARD <br> Who died on 25<sup>th</sup> <br> February 1980 <br> Aged 71 <br> And of her husband <br> Frank Ernest <br> Who died on <br> 22<sup>nd</sup> May 1983 <br> Aged 75 <p></b></center><p>
<i>[This is the northernmost headstone in row (e) of section B. Note that the in-church plan of the churchyard does not depict this plot and has the northernmost plot in this row labelled as 107A "LAY, William", being the plot immediately to the north of 107, WICKSON, Rose. The in-church plan does not depict the WOODWARD burial, which is two years more recent than B107, and on this basis seems to be contemporary with the next row - (f). There is a raised mound to the north of this plot that may have been the site of a tree at one time which would explain that there seem to be no burials in this area.; BR:- "1980  29 Feb  WOODWARD  Evelyn Nellie  71  .  25-Feb-80  107B" - AND - "1983  26-May  WOODWARD  Frank Ernest  75  .    107B"]
