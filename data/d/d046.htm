<i>Small headstone with round top, and checked, then scotia shoulders. Ledger stone, unusual and complex design. It contains a raised design of a cross with a circle at its centre. The cross stands on an area that resembles a field of stones, and has two rectangular shapes either side of its base, that resemble tomb stones. The headstone, ledger stone and footstone are all aligned on a NE/SW orientation, rather than the usual E/W. The ledger stone is tapered from the small headstone to the even smaller footstone, and it is quite short, and is in proportion to the small stones. It suggests a child burial, but the person was 68 years old.</i><p>
