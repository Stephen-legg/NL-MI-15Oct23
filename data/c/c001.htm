<i>[He wears a long robe with ruff, a quilted cloak with epaulettes.   Plain long sleeves.   He is bare-headed with goatee beard and moustache.    She is dressed in a long gown with farthingale and train, plain long sleeves and a ruff. On her head is a French hood.    Either side of the shelf is an obelisk topped with a gold coloured ball finial.  Along the top is a decorated frieze with a winged cherub head in middle.    The shelf is supported by two brackets, each bearing a coat of arms.  Under the shelf is an apron with scrolled decorated platform on which kneel their four sons and four daughters.  The two elder sons are dressed in high collared doublet with breeches and cloak.    The two smaller boys wear collared doublet and breeches but no cloak.   All are bare-headed.    The girls are dressed as the mother but wear bonnets.  Below the apron is a rectangular tablet of black polished marble with the main inscription in Roman caps, incised, V-cut.. Between Robert and Marie there is another rectangular tablet inscribed with a verse from 1. Peter that is partially illegible: "The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and His eares are open unto their prayers; but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil". At the top of the memorial on a shelf is a decorated achievement bearing arms.   Either side is a decorated scroll and an obelisk.   Above the achievement is a small shield bearing arms.]
