<i>[Tomb chest with alabaster effigies of knight and lady set in a recess beneath a crocketed ogee arch with a foliated finial.   On each side there is a pinnacled shaft, about half way up on each shaft there is an angel holding a shield bearing family arms, neither shield shows any colour. On the East end:    Argent a chevron Sable between three mullets Azure. (Blackett) On the West end:    Sable an eagle displayed Argent beaked Sable. (Wilcot)    (Ref. c) The front face of the tomb chest is divided into eight blank openings with cusped ogee hooded arches; projections at the base of each opening, possibly for figures, of which no trace.    The openings are separated by buttress like shafts.    Three of the arches are in moderate condition, two are missing.    There is a similar arch at the west end of the tomb. The effigies are of different lengths and are not fixed to the tomb (Ref a).    The Knight wears armour with pointed bascinet, hauberk of chain mail, gauntlets; on the left side is a sword in a scabbard which is broken.    On the upper part of the scabbard are carved the letters IHC.   His feet rest on a lion, his head on a helm with the family crest, a demi- eagle displayed Argent beaked Sable; the latter is broken.    Immediately above the knight's forehead there is a carved Latin abbreviation IHC NA AREN.    On the breast plate a large eagle is displayed. The lady wears a richly folded robe with a high stiff open collar; her hair is gathered into a crespine head dress with a highly decorative circlet of padded material and a jewelled net.   Her cushion is supported by an angel, at her feet two dogs who grip the folds of her robe in their teeth.   Each figure wears an 'S' collar. Many graffiti from following centuries, especially dates and initials, mainly on the Knight.  (Ref. b)  Materials: Figures alabaster, tomb chest stone. Date: Second quarter 15th century (Ref a) Dimensions: Arch: h. 428cm x w.  288 cm. Tomb chest: h. 90 cm x w.227 cm x d. 117 cm. Knight: 1. 202 cm. x 59 cm.   Lady: 1. 186 cm x 50 cm. Builder:  The chapel has been attributed to the master mason Richard Winchcombe. The effigies are not fixed to the tomb; Sir William's may have been prised from the centre to make room for his wife's,    (Ref a). References: a) VCH p.233     b) PEVS p.720     c) BURKE'S.   Note: A license to construct the Wilcote Chapel was obtained by Lady Elizabeth Blackett (as she then was) in 1438 . -+-+-+-+-+-+-  The square wall slab faces the chest tomb and alabaster figures. Roman caps in black paint. Blackened marble 75 cm. x 55 cm. overall. Translation: "Here lie William WILCOTES soldier and wife Elizabeth that John BLAKET of Icombe soldier later married. They departed from life - William A.D. 1411, John A.D. 1431, Elizabeth A.D. 1442". John Blaket is buried at Icombe. The dates given for John and Elizabeth differ from most other sources. The style of the lettering suggests a mid 19<sup>th</sup> century date. The inscription is faded and only decipherable under strong lighting. ]
