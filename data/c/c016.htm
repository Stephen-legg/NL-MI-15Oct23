Behind the figures are two arched tablets in black marble bearing the inscription in incised Roman caps painted gold.    Between the inscription panels is a coat of arms. On the roof of the alcove are two winged cherub heads, the one above Frances is badly damaged.   Beneath the kneeling figures on a shelf are four daughters in black robes with hands clasped.    The heads are missing.   Where the sons once were is now blank.    The alcove is flanked by two obelisks, at the base of each a gilded lion's head. Either side of the shelf are two small plinths fronted with a recessed black marble panel.   Below the shelf and at the base of each plinth a pendant finial of a bunch of grapes and vine leaves.    Surmounting the alcove is a shield bearing the coat of arms and topped by four winged cherubs between the arms of a cross.   Above them is an open urn with flame. .
