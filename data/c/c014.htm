<i>[Large white marble rectangular inscription tablet with lugged architrave with black marble edging, splayed bottom corners. Flanked by wide scrolled volute with foliate decoration.    Frieze of acanthus leaves beneath a stepped cornice, surmounted by elaborate scrolled tympanum enclosing a painted coat of arms, above which is a cherubs head surmounted by a flaming urn finial.    Either side of the central finial is a leaved scroll.   Beneath the main a shelf with gadrooned upper surface in black marble.    Lower surface a wave moulding decorated with swags of flowers on a central blank cartouche. Below this is an apron consisting of a scallop shell flanked by leaves and berries.    Inscription in black Italic lettering. -- Heraldry:-Sinister - Gules three pears Argent 2 + 1 on a Chief of the second a Demi-Lion rampant issuant Sable langued of the field.   Dexter   -   Azure five Fusils conjoined in fess Argent. -- Inscription translated by Harry Carter, 30 June 1968 - "Here lies James PERROT of North Leigh, Esquire, who was endowed with such superiority of mind and manners, that he seemed as though born for the loftiest affairs; yet he adopted, and graced, a private station, and led with dignity and always most happily a life of ease at his home, the best of husbands, fathers, hosts, and patrons. His moderate expenditure made his wealth the more honourable, by an unflagging generosity to the needy he removed such a thing as poverty far from the neighbourhood. Amid the turmoils of a most troublous time, in youth and age he was firm in his allegiance to the English Church and monarchy. More eloquently than any monument this building ornamented at his cost testifies to a worshipper of God as liberal as he was sincere. When at last he appears in the assembly he 'shall make glad the City of God'*  He died on 24 January, A.D. 1724, aged 85. Here was laid to share the tomb Anna, a wife worthy of such a husband, an admirably prolific mother who held in her embrace children resembling both parents by their virtues, and exchanged their loving companionship for heaven on 19 October A.D. 1729, aged 77". (* Psalm 46:4.) ]
