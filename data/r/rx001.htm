<i>Cremation Plot - Memorial Wall - various brass plaques are fixed onto the north face of the memorial wall, and most of these are detailed individually in plot records below. However, there are one or two memorial plaques that do not appear in the North Leigh Burial Register or any other known record. In this case, these plaques are described under this initial record, as follows:</i><p>
<center><b>In loving memory of <br> Olive Rita DURNIN <br> 22.9.1943 - 27.12.2002 <br> Michael A. E. DURNIN <br> 26.7.1941 - 13.6.2015 <br> A love that will last forever. <p></b></center><p>
<i>Cremation plot - brass plaque on memorial wall - not listed in North Leigh BR or any other churchyard record.</i><p>
<center><b>In loving memory <br> of our Mum <br> Dorothy WINFIELD <br> 08.09.1928 - 16.11.2008 <p></b></center><p>
<i>Cremation plot - brass plaque on memorial wall - not listed in North Leigh BR or any other churchyard record.</i><p>
<center><b>In loving memory of <br> Lucy Irene WILLIS <br> Born 23.2.1921 <br> Died 19.11.94 <br> Fondest memories R.I.P. <p></b></center><p>
<i>[  Note that the original plan for the cremation area specified plots to be 18" square, with rows identified A - M in a sequence, with row A on the east side of the memorial wall and row M closest to the boundary wall. Plots were to be numbered 1-19 within the rows A-C, from the east side to the west side, But in time memorial tablets were placed exceeding the dimensions (18" square), upsetting the grid plan. The churchwardens wrote in 2001 to the Parish Council (who were thought to be responsible for interrals at this time), suggesting that no further interrals should be made in in rows A - C, and recommending enlarging the plot size for rows D - H to 24" square, allowing for 15 plots per row. These recommendations were not implemented, so that interrals in recent years seem to have been placed in arbitrary positions, with no control of the size of any monument. The monuments have been recorded with respect to the plot identifications given in the burial register, where possible. ]
